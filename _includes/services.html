				<h3 class="c-heading-sub">Web development</h3>
				<p>I have worked extensively leading teams on Magento 2 and with CMSs like <b>Wordpress</b>, <b>Craft</b> or <b>Perch</b>, and with back-end frameworks like <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>CakePHP</b> or <b>Laravel</b>. If you don't want the overhead of working with an agency, I can assemble a trusted team to <b>deliver amazing value</b> in creating end-to-end website design and development.</p>

				<h3 class="c-heading-sub">Team reinforcement</h3>
					<p>Development teams often have to work under time pressure, and half way through a project, realise they could use another pair of competent hands. I can help. I have worked with many frameworks and UI kits and I can jump in the middle of a project and integrate with a team to deliver on time and budget.</p>

				<h3 class="c-heading-sub">App development</h3>
				<p>I have worked on many Javascript single page applications using Angular and most recently Vue and React and it's by far the most fun I've had working for this reason app development is extremely interesting to me.</p>
