				<p>I have worked extensively leading teams on <b>Magento 2</b> and with CMSs like <b>Wordpress</b>, <b>Craft</b> or <b>Perch</b>, and with back-end frameworks like <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>CakePHP</b> or <b>Laravel</b>. If you don't want the overhead of working with an agency, I can assemble a trusted team to <b>deliver amazing value</b> in creating end-to-end website design and development.</p>

				<h3 class="c-heading-sub">Magento 2 Consulting</h3>
					<p>I have helped several teams in creating an optimised system to build <b>Magento 2</b> projects efficiently. If your Magento 2 projects are always delayed I can definitely help.</p>

				<h3 class="c-heading-sub">PWA Development</h3>
				<p>I have worked on many Javascript SPA using Angular and most recently I've enjoyed Vue and React to build <b>headless Magento 2</b> stores and it's by far the most fun I've had working with Magento for this reason app development is extremely interesting to me.</p>
